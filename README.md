# Multi-Modal Search Engine: A Student's Ultimate Study Companion

Welcome to your new favorite project! This document outlines the exciting mission to build a multi-modal search engine designed to supercharge your study sessions. Think of it as a personal library assistant that understands everything you throw at it—from lecture notes and videos to assignments and past papers.

The goal? To create a platform where you and your classmates can upload, organize, and magically search through your academic materials to find exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.
The Fun-ctional Side of Things

## Here's a breakdown of the awesome features we'll be building:

### Search & Discover
- Text Sleuth: Got a keyword stuck in your head? Just type it in and let our engine find the relevant snippets in all your notes, documents, and even video transcripts.
- Visual Wizard: Snap a photo of a complicated diagram or a whiteboard scribble. Our search engine will work its magic to find similar diagrams or content within your uploads.
- Hybrid Hero: Combine your powers! Search for "vector calculus" while uploading a photo of a diagram to pinpoint exactly what you're looking for.
- Instant Access: Upload a new file and boom—it's immediately searchable. No more waiting around!

### Data Power-Ups
- Easy Upload: Drag and drop your notes, videos, assignments, and past papers (PDFs, MP4s, DOCX files—you name it) with a simple flick of your wrist.
- The Daft Difference: We'll be using the super-fast Daft framework to process all your files and get them ready for prime-time searching.
- Vector Vault: Our engine will be powered by LanceDB, a cutting-edge database that stores your academic content as vectors for lightning-fast, "I know what you mean" style searches.
- Full Control: You'll have complete power to create, read, update, and delete all your uploaded materials. Your data, your rules.

### User Experience: Built for Students, By Students
- A Joy to Use: The interface will be clean, intuitive, and a pleasure to use, so you can spend less time fumbling around and more time actually studying.
- Upload Made Simple: Get your files in the system with an effortless drag-and-drop or a quick browse.
- Results that Rock: Search results will be beautifully organized and easy to scan, with helpful previews so you can instantly see if you've found what you're looking for.

## Non-Functional Requirements : Beyond the Basics: Making it Awesome

## These are the "secret sauce" ingredients that will make our project truly shine.
### Speed & Scale
- Blazing Fast: Searches must be quick—we're talking under 200 milliseconds. No student has time to wait!
- Ready for Anything: The system will be built to handle a ton of users and their huge datasets without breaking a sweat.
- Data Dynamo: Our upload pipeline will be a beast, handling high volumes of new data without a hitch.

### Trust & Dependability
- Always On: The system will be available 24/7, because inspiration to study can strike at any time.
- Rock Solid: We're building a system that can withstand a few bumps, so your precious data is always safe.

### Top-Secret Security
- Fort Knox Security: All your personal notes and files will be encrypted, so they stay private and secure.
- Your Eyes Only: You're the only one who can access your data. This is a personal study companion, after all.
- Tightly Secured Code: We'll be using all the best practices to keep our code safe from prying eyes.

### Easy to Build & Maintain
- Crystal Clear Code: The codebase will be well-documented and easy to read, perfect for a course project with multiple contributors.
- No Bugs Allowed: We'll have a comprehensive testing system to ensure the project runs smoothly and stays that way.
- Anywhere, Anytime: With Docker, this project will be super easy to deploy and run, no matter what environment you're in.
